Hobby web project for practicing ASP.NET MVC 5  

In progress...

For now it has basic functionalities:  
-registering new users and login  
-creating new topics and posts  

Still need to implement various different things like:  
-personal messages (allows users to send messages to each other)  
-profile management (allows users to upload profile picture, change password, verify email)  
-highlighting unread threads  
-admin options (allows admins to delete threads, posts and ban users)  
etc...

Development stopped
